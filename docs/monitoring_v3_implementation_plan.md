# GENESIS Monitoring V3 Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step plan for implementing GENESIS Monitoring V3, which focuses on unifying the monitoring architecture while maintaining compatibility with V2. The plan follows an iterative approach, focusing on architectural changes first, then enhancing the monitoring capabilities.

## Goals
1. Unify monitoring architecture across all endpoint types
2. Make all monitoring events data-centric and queryable
3. Maintain backward compatibility with V2
4. Enable better state management and relationship tracking
5. Keep clear separation between data and presentation

## Helpful info
The GUID format 01019468a04f6ea7aadc529580002103 is a standard DDS GUID format where:
The first part (01019468a04f6ea7) is typically the participant ID
The middle part (aadc5295) is the entity kind and key
The last part (80002103) identifies the specific DDS entity (in this case, the reply DataWriter)

## Core Architectural Changes

### Phase 1: Base Layer Implementation
**File: genesis_lib/genesis_base.py**
1. Create core entity management:
   - Entity registry
   - State tracking
   - Participant correlation
   - Basic event types
   Test: Verify basic entity management

2. Implement monitoring primitives:
   - Event definitions
   - State management
   - Relationship tracking
   Test: Verify monitoring capabilities

### Phase 2: Monitored Endpoint Layer
**File: genesis_lib/monitored_endpoint.py**
1. Create common monitoring behaviors:
   - Lifecycle management
   - Health monitoring
   - Event aggregation
   - Relationship tracking
   Test: Verify common behaviors

2. Implement information flow:
   - Event propagation
   - State synchronization
   - Configuration distribution
   Test: Verify information flow

### Phase 3: Specialized Endpoint Updates
**Files: service_base.py, interface_base.py, agent_base.py**
1. Refactor service base:
   - Migrate from enhanced_service_base.py
   - Integrate with monitored_endpoint
   - Maintain service-specific features
   Test: Verify service functionality

2. Refactor interface base:
   - Migrate from monitored_interface.py
   - Integrate with monitored_endpoint
   - Maintain interface-specific features
   Test: Verify interface functionality

3. Refactor agent base:
   - Migrate from monitored_agent.py
   - Integrate with monitored_endpoint
   - Maintain agent-specific features
   Test: Verify agent functionality

### Phase 4: Data Model Updates
**File: datamodel.xml**
1. Update entity definitions:
   ```xml
   <struct name="EntityInfo">
     <member name="primary_id" type="string"/>
     <member name="preferred_name" type="string"/>
     <member name="participants" type="StringSequence"/>
     <member name="role" type="EntityRole"/>
     <member name="state" type="EntityState"/>
     <member name="capabilities" type="StringSequence"/>
   </struct>
   ```
   Test: Verify schema updates

2. Add relationship tracking:
   ```xml
   <struct name="EntityRelationship">
     <member name="source_id" type="string"/>
     <member name="target_id" type="string"/>
     <member name="relationship_type" type="RelationType"/>
     <member name="metadata" type="string"/>
   </struct>
   ```
   Test: Verify relationship modeling

### Phase 5: Monitor Implementation
**File: genesis_monitor.py**
1. Update entity visualization:
   - Support new entity model
   - Show relationships
   - Display state information
   Test: Verify visualization

2. Implement analysis features:
   - Entity filtering
   - Relationship analysis
   - State tracking
   Test: Verify analysis capabilities

## Testing Strategy
For each phase:
1. Unit test new components
2. Integration test with existing components
3. Verify V2 compatibility:
   - Event structure
   - Visualization
   - Existing functionality
4. Test information flow:
   - Event propagation
   - State management
   - Configuration distribution

## Success Criteria
1. All endpoints use unified monitoring architecture
2. Entity management is consistent across system
3. V2 compatibility is maintained
4. Relationships are properly tracked
5. State management is reliable
6. Monitor displays unified view

## Rollback Plan
For each phase:
1. Keep V2 implementations as reference
2. Maintain separate branches
3. Document all changes
4. Test V2 compatibility
5. Prepare rollback procedures

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 3 days
- Phase 2: 3 days
- Phase 3: 4 days
- Phase 4: 2 days
- Phase 5: 3 days
- Testing and refinement: 3 days

Total estimated time: 18 days

## Notes
- Focus on architectural changes first
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout
- Document all architectural decisions
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Update documentation with new architecture

## Future Architectural Considerations

### Monitoring Architecture Evolution
The current implementation maintains separate monitoring in `enhanced_service_base.py`, `monitored_interface.py`, and `monitored_agent.py`. A future refactor should consider a more unified approach:

```
genesis_base.py           - Core entity/monitoring logic
├── monitored_endpoint.py - Common monitoring behaviors
    ├── service_base.py   - Service-specific features
    ├── interface_base.py - Interface-specific features
    └── agent_base.py     - Agent-specific features
```

This refactor would need to address:

1. Information Flow:
   - Low-level libraries → Genesis Base → Monitored Endpoint → Specific Endpoint → App
   - Event propagation and aggregation
   - State management and synchronization
   - Configuration distribution

2. Key Challenges:
   - Maintaining backward compatibility
   - Preserving specialized behaviors
   - Managing state ownership
   - Handling cross-cutting concerns

3. Benefits:
   - Unified entity management
   - Consistent monitoring patterns
   - Clearer responsibility separation
   - Better scalability

This architectural evolution should be considered for future releases after V3 monitoring is stable and validated.
